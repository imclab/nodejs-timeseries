## Simple Timeseries Getter ##

Add node.io jobs, call these,  add to a database.

* Default configuration has the db in `data/timeseries.db`
* To install dependencies, run `npm link`
* Now run `node getts` to print the help

There is no query module now. Use your SQL skills :)

Added two samples `flipkart.js` and `yahoofin.js`. These two reads
the item/ticker information from their respective data files and 
then gets the data accordingly.

These are used as samples to get you started.
